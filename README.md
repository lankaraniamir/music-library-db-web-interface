# Music Library Database Web Interface

## Description
This is a PostgreSQL database and a corresponding web interface that can be used to store and access the data within any personal or professional music library. I created this database to store my own music in a way that made it easy: to extract audio data for my research studies, to find multiple versions of a song for my DJ sets & music production, to listen to my music in traditional forms such as an album, and to allow my library to be shared by my roommates as different users.
